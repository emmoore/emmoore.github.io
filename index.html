                            In every school in the united states and in other countries there is bullying.  If you look at the schools anti-bullying systems then you can see that they are falling apart.  What I mean is that most schools will look at bullyies and just say to them "stop".  What do you think that is going to do if that is all they say over and over again.  In schools anti-bullying system when a kid is being bullied from a bully and someone tells a teacher about the bully the school is most likely going to go to the parents and say "Hey you child has been bullying a kid at our school".  Then the parents might say to there child you need to stop, but half of the time if your parents do not know what to do then they are going to say to the school you need to do something about this.  The school 75% of the time will not know what to do and they only will know to say back to the parents "We can't do anything to stop your child so you need to deal with your child".  At this point if the parents do not know how to deal with there child this will be an on going cycle of just Parents to school to parents to school.  This is a big example of the school anti-bullying system falling apart.  Now if the parent know what to do then they will probobly try to stop there child from bullying but the thing is the child that was bullied is still scard in there heart from all the things that that one bully did to them.  These scares are from the bully using words to hurt the other kid.  Back then when bullying took place it would be mostly physically, but now 90% of the bully population hurts the kid they bully with words.  The schools that are out there have terrible systems that need help.

                            In life there are many ways we can help the bullied.  One way is you can stick up for those who are bullied and we can stand beside them in there struggle.  One other way that we could help and the way the schools could make there system better is if we could have clubs in every school that could train kids to protect the bullied and to help the bullies.  One way we could all do this is by training kids to help with the bullied and in schools the trained kids could pick one of the bullied kids and go to every class with them and stay with them when they go places in the school so if a bully came up to the other kid the trained kid would be right there with him and stick up for him.  This system would help so much that some of the bullys might look at this trained kid and think "oh no it is one of those trained anti-bullying kids".  This may stop a lot of kids from being bullied.  One last way we could help is in schools open a club for bullies and help them try to also help others stop bullying.  This would help because they would then know what it is like to bea bully and they could talk to other bullys and tell them that they have had the same struggle.  This could stop many of the bullies from bullying others and to help the bullies.

                            I have a freind who is bullied every day and one thing you can do is stcik up for them.  If you stcik up for them there is a chance that the bully will just leave.  Another thing you could do is open clubs to deal with bullying.  These are some things you can do to help your freinds.  One last thing you can do to help your freinds is get to know them better.  Go help your freinds that are bullied and help them in the struggle.
